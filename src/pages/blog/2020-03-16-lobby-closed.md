With the health and safety of our customers and employees in mind the lobby at the Grayson Utilities Commission building will be closed to the public starting March 17,2020, until further notice.  However, our drive-thru still remains open to accept cash and check payments.  We also offer a variety of ways to pay your bill:  ACH (strongly recommended as the best payment method), online, by mail, by phone, drive-thru and night deposit box.  You can connect to our online payment site at www.graysonutilities.com or through our Advisory App which is free to download from either Google Play or Apple App Store, which will also allow you to recieve any advisories or alerts we may send out.  The phone number to the office is 474-7569.  Please contact our office if you have questions. 

Thank You

GUC
