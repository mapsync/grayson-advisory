Due to the Sewer Rehab Project, contractors dug into the water line causing a water outage for customers on Malone Lane, Shady Lane, N Court St, and Maplewood Dr.  You are already on a boil water advisory and crews are working to try to get your water back on as soon as they can.  

If you have any questions, you can call the office at 606-474-7569 or the Water Treatment Plant at 606-474-5731.
