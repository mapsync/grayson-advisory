We are currently working on a water leak on North Highway 1 at the Carter County Soccer Field.  When water service is restored a boil water advisory is in effect for North highway 1 from the Carter County Soccer Field north to the end of the line ending at the Carter/Greenup County line, including all side roads.  See the attached map for the map of the effected area.
