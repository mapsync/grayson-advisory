The contractors are moving right along.  Although work may be a little slower this week due to rain the contractors are still working.  They are steadilly making there way through the area, and Steve O'Pell says he is confident they should be finished by the end of February, foreseeing any problems.  

Although there are no scheduled road closings, if you find yourself blocked in and need to get out or in, please call the office at 606-474-7569 for assistance.  Also, there are no scheduled water outages at this time, although it is possible the water may need to go off, as is possible any time there is utility work being done.  

We will keep you informed here on this site.  Please spread the word to your neighbors about this app so it is easier to have knowledge of what is going on anytime through the day or night using this app.   

Thank you for your patience as we are in the construction phase of the sewer rehab project. 

Watch this app and our web site to stay informed of work areas, road closings, outages and boil waters even after this project is finished. 

For any questions or concerns, call the Grayson Utilities office at 606-474-7569 or after hours at 606-474-5731.
