Due to the sewer rehab work being done by Steve O'Pell Construction, they are next to Joyce Rice house on Shady Lane today and will be working also on Maplewood Drive and Malone Lane in the grassy areas for this week.  The water will be off again today, Tuesday, 12/3/19, for these areas, hopefully to be back on by 1:00 pm, but could be off longer.  You are still on a boil water advisory.  We will notify you throgh this app and radio when it gets lifted.

Thank you for your patience as we are in the construction phase of the sewer rehab project. 

Watch this app and our web site to stay informed of work areas, road closings, outages and boil waters. 

For any questions or concerns, call the Grayson Utilities office at 606-474-7569.
