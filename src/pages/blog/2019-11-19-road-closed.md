Due to the sewer rehab work being done by Steve O'Pell Construction, they are next to Joyce Rice house on Shady Lane today and will be working towards Maplewood Drive and Malone Lane in the grassy areas for this week.  There are no scheduled outages at this time, although it is possible the water may need to go off again.  We will keep you informed here on this site.   

Thank you for your patience as we are in the construction phase of the sewer rehab project. 

Watch this app and our web site to stay informed of work areas, road closings, outages and boil waters even after this project is finished. 

For any questions or concerns, call the Grayson Utilities office at 606-474-7569.
