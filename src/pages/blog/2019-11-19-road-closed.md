Due to the sewer rehab work being done by Steve O'Pell Construction, they are still next to Joyce Rice house on Shady Lane today and will be working on Maplewood Drive next week.  They will be going down the center of the road and working on the side of the road putting in a drain tile.  The road is going to be closed for the biggest part of the time they are in there.  There are no scheduled water outages at this time, although it is possible the water may need to go off again.  We will keep you informed here on this site.  Please spread the word to your neighbors about this app so it is easier to have knowledge of what is going on anytime through the day or night using this app.  

Thank you for your patience as we are in the construction phase of the sewer rehab project. 

Watch this app and our web site to stay informed of work areas, road closings, outages and boil waters even after this project is finished. 

For any questions or concerns, call the Grayson Utilities office at 606-474-7569.
