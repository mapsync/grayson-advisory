The sewer rehab work is being done by Steve O'Pell Construction and Unger Construction.  They are working on Malone Lane this week and although there are no scheduled road closings if you find yourself blocked in and need to get out or in, please call the office at 606-474-7569 for assistance.    

There are no scheduled water outages at this time, although it is possible the water may need to go off again.  We will keep you informed here on this site.  Please spread the word to your neighbors about this app so it is easier to have knowledge of what is going on anytime through the day or night using this app.  

Thank you for your patience as we are in the construction phase of the sewer rehab project. 

Watch this app and our web site to stay informed of work areas, road closings, outages and boil waters even after this project is finished. 

For any questions or concerns, call the Grayson Utilities office at 606-474-7569.
