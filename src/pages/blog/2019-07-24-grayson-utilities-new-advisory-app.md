# \    ADVISORY APP

To communicate more effectively and become more transparent with our customers/citizens, Grayson Utilities Commission has invested in designing and building our very own Advisory App and has connected with the Play & Apple Stores.  Our plans are to utilize this App to better communicate information to you, our customer.

A few examples of the types of advisories we may be sending out are as follows:

•	Construction Activities

•	Maintenance Activities

•	Boil Water Advisories

•	Detours

•	Community Events

•	Provide Educational Information

•	Staff Recognition

•	Consumer Confidence Reports

•	Board Meeting Reminders

•	Payment Reminders

•	Connection to On-line Bill Pay

•	Connect to Customer Service email

•	Provide Contact Information for key staff members

•	Anything that would typically be advertised in the newspaper

•	Miscellaneous information, i.e. change in schedules

 To install the App, you **DO NOT** need to contact us, or complete a profile that includes any personal information.  Merely do the following:  

•	**Click on the Play or Apple Stores**

o	Then, type Grayson Utilities Commission Advisory or GUC Advisory,

o	Then, click on the App,

o	Then, click Install.

o	You are COMPLETE, you will now receive Alerts/Notifications

o	Alerts will be silent,

o	Notifications are for emergencies and will ding or vibrate.

o	You can also pay your bill from this App

Please consider trying it out. It could be very helpful to you, your family and friends.  You can delete it at any time and we welcome your feedback.
